You know that feeling when your friend tells you he's flying to a place you've already been? And it's been three years and you forgot the places you traveled to?

That's what this app was created for! You will be able to concentrate all your trips in one place.

You can add photos, add a location, rate the trip you had, write who you traveled with and exactly which countries you were in

The app uses Firebase -

Realtime Database - saves the data of the existing users, and the data of the trips

Storage - to save the photos of all the trips

Authentication - to connect and register - checking whether a user exists, and creating a new user if necessary

In addition, the
Google Maps API - to select a location on the map, and to display the location where you traveled on the map.

Additional libraries used-

binding - for linking the Excel files to the code snippets

Progress Dialog - Displays a message while the application is loading information

Android Patterns - for the purpose of identifying whether an email address entered is in the correct format

Toast - show messages

Date picker dialog - enter the start date of the trip

Glide - for uploading photos for a trip

Lottie - display an animation while the application is loading
